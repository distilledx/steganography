# steganography
*A pretty good image steganography program made with python*

Functions a lot better than traditional methods using LSB and about as good as DCT and other frequency domain techniques

Do not save the image as jpg(or any lossy compression formats) to avoid messing up the encryption due to compression

Encryption is limited to characters of ascii values between 0 and 999

[Difference between an non encrypted image and an image encrypted with 997 characters magnified upto 99999999x](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/796060146048041023/833572684729810954/output.png) The colored dots represent the change in the image
